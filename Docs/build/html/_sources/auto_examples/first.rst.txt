Examples
====================

Here are some examples on how to use the models in the library. These examples are meant to  
showcase each model and method defined in the library. Some utility methods, such as certain metrics,  
are omitted, as the author believes such examples have little to no practical use. However, most core  
features and functionalities are demonstrated through these examples.  

Each example is designed to illustrate the model's usage, behavior, and performance in various scenarios.  
The provided scripts include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization where applicable.  
By following these examples, users can gain a better understanding of how to effectively apply the models  
to different machine learning tasks.
