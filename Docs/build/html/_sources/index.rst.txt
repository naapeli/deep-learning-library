Deep learning library documentation
===================================

DLL is a deep learning library inspired by TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. It encompasses a wide range of deep learning and machine learning methods and includes numerous examples and tests to demonstrate their usage.

This library is intended as an educational project. While it offers a variety of functionalities, its performance and efficiency may not match those of the aforementioned libraries. Therefore, for production-level applications, it is recommended to use TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn. However, DLL aims to provide greater clarity and ease of understanding compared to other libraries.
