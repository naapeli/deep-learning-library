# DLL

my own deep learning library

Upcoming topics:

- saving a model (as JSON???)
- data transformation layers (translate, rotate, scale, reshape, clamp)
- LSTM layers
- gaussian noise layer
- text vectorisation layer???
- Attention layer???
- other machine learning methods (linear regression, svm, naive bayes, decision trees, knn ...)
- early stopping and other callbacks

Run tests from deep-learning-library-folder by eg. python -m Tests.TestingDecisionTree
