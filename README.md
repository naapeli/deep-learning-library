my own deep learning library

Upcoming topics:

- saving a model (as JSON???)
- gradient descent optimiser
- 2d convolutional layer
- 2d pooling layer
- adam optimiser
- data transformation layers (translate, rotate, scale, normalisation, reshape, flatten, clamp)
- RNN, LSTM layers
- gaussian noise layer
- text vectorisation layer???
- Attention layer???
- other machine learning methods (linear regression, svm, naive bayes, decision trees, knn ...)
- early stopping and other callbacks
