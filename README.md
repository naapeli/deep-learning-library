# DLL (Deep Learning Library)

DLL is a deep learning library inspired by TensorFlow and PyTorch. This is my largest project to date, featuring thousands of lines of code. It encompasses a wide range of deep learning and machine learning methods, and includes numerous examples and tests to demonstrate their usage.

## Upcoming topics:
- finishing the documentation (and making the error handling good)
- other optimizers
- saving a model
- data transformation layers (translate, rotate, scale, reshape, clamp)
- gaussian noise layer
- text vectorisation layer???
- Attention layer???
- early stopping and other callbacks???

## Running Tests
To run the tests, navigate to the deep-learning-library-folder and use eg. the following command:
```
python -m Tests.TestingDecisionTree
```

Feel free to explore the code and apply it to new problems!
